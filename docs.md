Creating recipes: Users can add their recipes via the add recipe form page only after completing the user registration form, as guest users canâ€™t have access to the add recipe form page.
Discovering recipes: Any registered or guest user can access the discover page, where they can find the desired recipes.

User Stories:

Title: User registration.

Title: Creating Recipes
As a registered user, I want to create new recipes with homemade ingredients so that this can help other users or guests guide them in cooking dishes.

Title: Searching the recipe by title.
As a user, I want to search the recipe with respect to the title, so that I can find my desired recipe with ease.

Structure:
The project consists of the Welcome page, User registration page, Recipe creating page, Recipe details page and Recipe discover page. All of these front-end pages will be implemented in HTML, CSS, and JS. All the logic and feature handling will be implemented in Python. All the data management such as adding and retrieving data will be handled using SQLite/PostgreSQL.
