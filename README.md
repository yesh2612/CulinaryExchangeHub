# CulinaryExchangeHub
Project Overview:
The project involves building a web application that allows users to create, share, discover, and rate recipes.

Technologies and Tools:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interface and interactions. 
Backend: Python (Flask or Django) for server-side logic and database management. 
Database: SQL database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store user data, recipes, ratings, and other comments.

We are using python, as it has extensive library apis, and it is versatile, easy to learn and write.
